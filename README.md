# Plotly
# Background
Roza has a partially completed dashboard that she needs to finish. She has a completed panel for demographic information and now needs to visualize the bacterial data for each volunteer. Specifically, her volunteers should be able to identify the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons. That way, if Improbable Beef identifies a species as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef, Roza's volunteers will be able to identify whether that species is found in their navel.

# What You're Creating
This new assignment consists of four technical analysis deliverables. You will submit the following:
Deliverable 1: Create a Horizontal Bar Chart
Deliverable 2: Create a Bubble Chart
Deliverable 3: Create a Gauge Chart
Deliverable 4: Customize the Dashboard

# Challenge
For this module of challenge, we are using our skills in HTML, JavaScript, Plotly, and D3.js to create three charts in order ot display the top 10 bacterial species (OTUs) when an individual’s ID is selected from the dropdown menu on the webpage.

From the website, the left side bar allow you to search for different Test Subject ID NO., which allow you to upload the demographic info of each subject.

The first Chart is a bar chart, display the top 10 bacterial species (OTUs) when an individual’s ID is selected from the dropdown menu on the webpage.The horizontal bar chart will display the sample_values as the values, the otu_ids as the labels, and the otu_labels as the hover text for the bars on the chart.

Second it is a bubble chart, it is doing the same idea as bar chat, will display the following when an individual’s ID is selected from the dropdown menu webpage.
The otu_ids as the x-axis values.
The sample_values as the y-axis values.
The sample_values as the marker size.
The otu_ids as the marker colors.
The otu_labels as the hover-text values.

Last one is a gauge chat, hat displays the weekly washing frequency's value, and display the value as a measure from 0-10 on the progress bar in the gauge chart when an individual ID is selected from the dropdown menu.
